"Patient D is an 86-year-old [race] [gender] with history of multiple myeloma who presents with 6 months of progressive neck pain and limb weakness. Patient D states that [possessive] pain is triggered by flexion or extension of [possessive] neck. The pain has become severe and [subject] is worried that it prevents [possessive] participation in daily activities. Patient D is also requiring more assistance to ambulate, citing that [subject] is feeling weakness of [possessive] arms and legs. NSAIDs have not provided any pain relief. Through physical examination, you detect diffuse numbness and weakness in all [possessive] extremities. You also identify Hoffmann signs and hyperreflexia in both of [possessive] arms and legs. You obtain MRI and CT scans of [possessive] cervical spine, and discover a large tumor involving C4-C5 with epidural extension resulting in severe stenosis and kyphotic deformity. There are also innumerable osteolytic lesions throughout the visible spine segments. ","Would you offer morphine to Patient D? Yes or No? If yes, how much supply would you give – Low (1 week), or High (4 weeks) supply? Explain.",Yes,Low (1 week),"Patient D likely has myelopathy secondary to relapse of [possessive] multiple myeloma, with a new lesion that would likely require surgical intervention. While determining long term treatment options, pain control with opioids may be beneficial."
"Patient D is a 77-year-old [race] [gender] with history of lung cancer who presents with 3 months of diffuse back pain and progressive, unintentional weight loss. Patient D describes the pain as constant and exacerbated by bending and twisting movements of [possessive] spine. In addition to increasing pain, [subject] endorses progressive diffuse weakness, and [subject] now to requires a front-wheel-walker to ambulate. Upon examining Patient D, you find that [subject] is cachetic and diffusely deconditioned. You palpate the full length of [possessive] spine and note that [subject] is diffusely tender. You review the MRI of [possessive] full spine and identify innumerable lesions in all spine segments and multiple pathologic fractures.","Would you offer morphine to Patient D? Yes or No? If yes, how much supply would you give – Low (1 week), or High (4 weeks) supply? Explain.",Yes,Low (1 week),"Patient D likely has bone pain from progression of [possessive] lung cancer.

"Patient D is a 59-year-old [race] [gender] with neurofibromatosis with 8 months of progressive pain from thoracic spinal neurofibromas and a new diagnosis of glioblastoma after a recent seizure. Patient D explains that [subject] previously has managed [possessive] pain with NSAIDs and neuropathic medications, however [subject] noticed that it has progressed to the point that [possessive] regimen is no longer effective. When asked to describe the pain, [subject] says that it is sharp and radiates from [possessive] back to [possessive] sternum. On your physical examination, you find that Patient D has no focal neurological deficits. You decide to obtain a thoracic MRI for surveillance of [possessive] neurofibromas, and find that they have increased in size. ","Would you offer morphine to Patient D? Yes or No? If yes, how much supply would you give – Low (1 week), or High (4 weeks) supply? Explain.",Yes,Low (1 week),"Patient D has signs of progressive growth of [possessive] spinal neurofibromas and a new diagnosis of glioblastoma. Pending a comprehensive surgical and oncologic plan, it is reasonable to offer opioids for pain control."
"Patient D is a 75-year-old [race] [gender] with history of lung cancer and 4 months of progressive low-back and right leg pain. Patient D describes the pain as a dull ache that shoots down [possessive] right leg in no particular pattern or frequency. Recently, [subject] started experiencing intermittent numbness throughout [possessive] right leg. Overall, [subject] believes the pain is becoming more frequent and intolerable, as it now interrupts [possessive] sleep nightly and acetaminophen and ibuprofen have not helped. On your physical examination, you find that Patient D has diffusely diminished sensation in [possessive] leg, but [possessive] strength and reflexes are normal. Upon reviewing [possessive] lumbar spine MRI, you identify diffuse leptomeningeal disease. ","Would you offer morphine to Patient D? Yes or No? If yes, how much supply would you give – Low (1 week), or High (4 weeks) supply? Explain.",Yes,Low (1 week),"Patient D has leptomeningeal disease, which suggests recurrence and progression of malignancy. They will need an oncologic workup and treatment plan, and in the meantime it is reasonable to palliate [possessive] pain with opioids."
"Patient D is a 48-year-old [race] [gender] with history of colorectal cancer that has progressed despite aggressive therapy. Patient D began to experience diffuse back and pelvic pain 2 months ago but declined a visit to [possessive] oncologist. Instead, [subject] tried to manage [possessive] pain with NSAIDs. Patient D now presents to you with intolerable pain, and [subject] says it has not responded to [possessive] efforts. On your. physical examination, you incidentally discover a left foot drop and diminished sensation in [possessive] left foot. MRI of [possessive] lumbar spine shows diffuse bony metastases, with a metastatic lesion involving the left L5-S1 neuroforamen.","Would you offer morphine to Patient D? Yes or No? If yes, how much supply would you give – Low (1 week), or High (4 weeks) supply? Explain.",Yes,Low (1 week),"Patient D has progressive back pain likely related to diffuse metastatic disease to the bone. While the lesion at L5-S1 may be surgical, a full discussion weighing the goals [possessive] goals of care in context of oncologic prognosis is warranted. Pain control with opioids until such planning is completed is reasonable. "
"Patient D is a 51-year-old [race] [gender] with renal cell carcinoma status-post T4-T7 corpectomy and fusion for spine metastases 6 months ago who presents with progressive leg pain. Patient D states that the pain [subject] had prior to [possessive] last surgery is returning and in a worse form.
