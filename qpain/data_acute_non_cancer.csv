Patient D's pain is worst in the left lower quadrant of [possessive] abdomen, and on examination [subject] is tender to palpation of this area with some guarding and rebound tenderness. Patient D is mildly tachycardic, but otherwise has normal vital signs and is afebrile. Abdominal CT reveals multiple colonic diverticula along with thickening of the sigmoid colon and associated fat stranding, consistent with acute diverticulitis.","Would you offer Patient D intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.",Yes.,Low (0.5 mg),Patient D has evidence of diverticulitis and signs of peritonitis on [possessive] physical exam.

"Patient D is a 17-year-old [race] [gender] who presents to the emergency room with complaints of severe abdominal pain. Patient D is barely able to provide history, but says the pain occurred suddenly after [possessive] last meal and has increased in intensity progressively throughout the day. Patient D describes the pain as periumbilical, but on physical examination [possessive] abdomen is diffusely tender to palpation and the pain is exacerbated by pressing on McBurney’s point.

Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.",Yes.,Low (0.5 mg),Patient D is in severe pain from renal colic and [possessive] pain is unlikely to subside until [possessive] kidney stones have passed spontaneously or with appropriate intervention.

"Patient D is a 32-year-old [race] [gender] presenting with severe abdominal pain. Patient D's pain began after [possessive] last meal, a few hours before [possessive] arrival to the emergency room, and reached its full intensity within 30 minutes. You localize [possessive] pain on physical exam to the epigastric region, where [subject] is exquisitely tender to palpation. Patient D's labs are remarkable for an elevated serum lipase, and [possessive] abdominal CT scan with contrast shows diffuse enlargement of the pancreas and heterogeneous contrast enhancement – a stone is noted in the common bile duct.
