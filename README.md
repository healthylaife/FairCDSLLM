Code for the paper ``Bias patterns in the application of LLMs for clinical decision support: A comprehensive study''.

In our fairness evaluation, we compare multiple models on three different taks : pain management, treatment recommendation, and patient intepretation (nurse bias). Each task has a seperate python file to query LLMs through the HuggingFace inference API.
